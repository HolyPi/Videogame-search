GameView was created with the motivation of wanting for people to have a concrete place for the searching of videogames that had both prices and platforms available. GameView was using an API in the beginning to make the search of searching for videogames possible, but sadly, the API (chickencoop) was not giving any response/it was down most of the time, so I had to hardcode the database of videogames. I didn't have enough time to polish on the design, as I had to start from scratch after realizing the API did not work as intended; but I was going for a simplistic, black and white design.
